# Development Workflow

Follow this simple process to work through the tasks in `generate-tasks.mdc`.

1.  **Choose a Task:** Select a task from the list, starting from the top of a phase.
2.  **Create a Branch:** Create a new git branch from `main` with a descriptive name.
    *   *Example:* `git checkout -b feature/custom-cursor`
3.  **Develop:** Write the code to complete the task on your new branch. Commit your changes regularly with clear messages.
4.  **Test:** Ensure the feature works as expected and doesn't break anything else. Check responsiveness if applicable.
5.  **Push and Merge:** Once the feature is complete and tested, push your branch to the remote repository. If working in a team, create a Pull Request. Otherwise, merge the branch back into `main`.
    *   *Example:*
        ```bash
        git checkout main
        git merge feature/custom-cursor
        git push origin main
        ```
6.  **Repeat:** Mark the task as complete and move to the next one.
