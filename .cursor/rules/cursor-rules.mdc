# Cursor Interaction Rules

This document provides a specific breakdown of all behaviors for the custom cursor.

### 1. Default State
*   **Appearance:** A thin, white, hollow circle (a ring).
*   **Behavior:** Smoothly follows the system mouse pointer with a slight delay (`lerp` or `spring` animation) to feel fluid. The system cursor is hidden.

### 2. Standard Hover State
*   **Trigger:** Hovering over standard interactive elements (buttons, simple links, icons).
*   **Animation:** The cursor ring smoothly scales up slightly and fills with solid white.
*   **Element Interaction:** The text or icon being hovered over inverts its color to black to maintain contrast.

### 3. Spotlight Hover State
*   **Trigger:** Hovering over large, outlined text (e.g., the links in the navigation overlay, the "AS WHO?" text).
*   **Animation:** The cursor transforms into a larger, semi-transparent grey circle.
*   **Element Interaction:** As the circle moves over the text, it "fills in" the outlines, making the portion of the text under the cursor appear solid white.

### 4. Colored Hover State
*   **Trigger:** Hovering over the "View Project" circular button in the portfolio section.
*   **Animation:** The cursor ring fills with the unique accent color associated with that specific project.
*   **Element Interaction:** The "View Project" text inverts to maintain readability against the new colored background.
